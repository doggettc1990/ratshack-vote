Creating a basic landing page for "Big Mack's Rat Shack" as a project for HTML and CSS practice.

10.30.2024 - Basic Concept for Project Created
______________________________________________
Landing page will be for voting for the father of the next litter for a specific female rat.  The top of the landing page will be a header showing the name of the business and some inactive links
to other aspects of the business.  Below the header will be a main section showing the female rat and some information about her.  After the will be a section displaying the various male rats
avaiable for breeding and descriptors about them.  The third section will be a simple description of the rat "dating show" and why the voting is happening.  Finally, the last section is a voting box
where you can choose the rat followed by a basic footer.

Plan to eventually add the ability to interact with the website, cast a vote, and store the votes to allow the vistors to see the total tally as I learn more about JavaScript, Databases, and Backend
development.
